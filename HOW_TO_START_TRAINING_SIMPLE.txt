       HOW TO START TRAINING - EXPLAINED LIKE YOU'RE 5 YEARS OLD
================================================================================

Imagine you're teaching a robot to catch bad guys.
The robot learns from EXAMPLES (called "datasets").
We show the robot LOTS of examples, and it learns patterns.
Then the robot can catch bad guys it's never seen before!

HERE'S WHAT YOU DO:

================================================================================
STEP 1: WHERE DO I PUT THE DATA?
================================================================================

Think of it like this: You have a toy box (your computer)
Inside the toy box, there's a folder called "ml" (the machine learning folder)
Inside "ml", there's a folder called "artifacts" (where data lives)
Inside "artifacts", there are more folders like:
  - datasets/
  - models/
  - logs/

TO PUT YOUR DATA:
1. Go to: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\
2. Put your data files there (CSV, JSON files with security events)
3. The computer will find them automatically

WHAT KIND OF DATA?
The system needs security event logs like:
  - Who logged in? (username, time, location)
  - What files did they access? (which files, how much data)
  - What commands did they run? (on the endpoint)
  - Which servers did they connect to? (network traffic)

EXAMPLE DATA FORMAT (Easy one):
  User,Time,Location,Action,Success
  john_smith,10:30AM,NYC,login,yes
  john_smith,10:45AM,NYC,file_read,yes
  john_smith,11:00AM,NYC,file_write,yes
  hacker_joe,2:00AM,China,file_read,yes
  hacker_joe,2:05AM,China,password_change,yes

================================================================================
STEP 2: HOW DO I START TRAINING?
================================================================================

OPTION A: SUPER EASY WAY (3 commands)

1. Open PowerShell (Windows command thing)
2. Type these 3 commands one by one:

   cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python run_service.py


WHAT HAPPENS?
- First command: Go to the machine learning folder
- Second command: Install all the tools the robot needs
- Third command: Start the training process!

The computer will:
✓ Look in the "datasets" folder
✓ Find your data files
✓ Read all the examples
✓ Learn patterns (training!)
✓ Save a smart robot (model) to "artifacts/models/"
✓ Show you how smart it got (accuracy percentage)


OPTION B: FASTER WAY (If you're on Mac/Linux)

cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
make run


(Windows doesn't have "make", so use Option A)

================================================================================
STEP 3: WHAT HAPPENS DURING TRAINING?
================================================================================

When you run the training, you'll see MESSAGES like:

  Loading dataset... ✓
  Found 10,000 security events
  Training threat classifier... [████████░░] 80%
  Training malware detector... [██████████] 100%
  Model accuracy: 92.3%
  ✓ Training complete!
  Models saved to: artifacts/models/

THIS IS GOOD! It means:
- The robot saw 10,000 examples
- It learned from them
- It got 92.3% accuracy (it's really smart!)
- It saved what it learned

================================================================================
STEP 4: HOW LONG DOES TRAINING TAKE?
================================================================================

SMALL dataset (100-1,000 events): 
  Maybe 2-5 minutes

MEDIUM dataset (1,000-10,000 events):
  Maybe 10-30 minutes

BIG dataset (100,000+ events):
  Maybe 1-3 hours

So... go get a snack! ☕

================================================================================
STEP 5: WHERE CAN I SEE THE RESULTS?
================================================================================

When training finishes, you'll see files created here:
  d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\models\

INSIDE YOU'LL SEE:
  - threat_classifier_model.pkl (the trained robot for threats)
  - malware_detector_model.pkl (the trained robot for viruses)
  - ueba_model.pkl (the trained robot for weird behavior)
  - etc.

YOU'LL ALSO SEE LOGS HERE:
  d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\logs\

THESE ARE LIKE A DIARY of what happened:
  "Started at 10:30 AM"
  "Processed 5,000 events"
  "Got 94.2% accuracy"
  "Finished at 10:45 AM"

================================================================================
STEP 6: HOW DO I KNOW IF IT WORKED?
================================================================================

GOOD SIGNS:
✓ You see "✓ Training complete!"
✓ Accuracy is above 90%
✓ No red ERROR messages
✓ Files appeared in the models/ folder

BAD SIGNS:
✗ You see RED ERROR messages
✗ Training stopped early
✗ Accuracy is below 80%
✗ No files in models/ folder


IF SOMETHING IS WRONG:
1. Check if your data is in the right folder
2. Check if the data format is correct
3. Look at the log files for clues
4. Ask for help with the error message

================================================================================
STEP 7: WHAT IF I WANT TO RETRAIN?
================================================================================

The robot learns better the more times you train it.
Just do it again:

1. Add MORE data to: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\
2. Run the training again (same 3 commands)
3. The robot learns more!

Every 2 weeks is good. (The robot forgets old stuff and learns new attacks!)

================================================================================
STEP 8: HOW DO I USE THE TRAINED ROBOT?
================================================================================

After training, the system AUTOMATICALLY starts protecting you!

The frontend & backend are already connected:
- New security events come in
- The trained robot checks them
- It tells you: "This looks normal ✓" or "This looks bad! ✗"
- You get alerts in the dashboard

NO EXTRA WORK NEEDED!

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE (COPY/PASTE COMMANDS)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open PowerShell
STEP 2: Copy and paste this:

cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_service.py

STEP 3: Wait for "Training complete!" ✓
STEP 4: Check results in artifacts/models/
STEP 5: Done! System is now protecting you!

================================================================================
PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"
SOLUTION: Run this command again:
          python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

PROBLEM: "Permission denied"
SOLUTION: Make sure you're in the right folder (use cd command)
          Or run PowerShell as Administrator

PROBLEM: "File not found"
SOLUTION: Your data files aren't in the right place
          Put them in: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\

PROBLEM: "Out of memory"
SOLUTION: Your dataset is too big
          Start with smaller dataset first
          Or restart your computer

PROBLEM: "Training is really slow"
SOLUTION: That's normal! Go get coffee ☕
          Big datasets take time

================================================================================
SUMMARY (IN 5 STEPS)
================================================================================

1. PUT DATA HERE:     d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\
2. OPEN POWERSHELL
3. RUN THIS:          cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
4. RUN THIS:          python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
