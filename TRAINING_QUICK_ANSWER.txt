================================================================================

The fastest answer to your question:


QUESTION 1: WHERE DO I INPUT THE DATASET?
───────────────────────────────────────────

PUT YOUR DATA HERE:

That's it! Drop CSV or JSON files there.


QUESTION 2: HOW DO I START TRAINING?
─────────────────────────────────────

Copy and paste these 3 commands in PowerShell:

  cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  python run_service.py

That's it! Training starts automatically.


WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
──────────────────

1. System finds your data files (in datasets/ folder)
2. Reads all the examples
3. Trains 22 AI models (robots)
4. Tells you the accuracy percentage
5. Saves the trained models
6. Starts protecting your network automatically
7. Dashboard shows results


TIME NEEDED:
────────────

Small data (100 events):      2-5 minutes
Medium data (1,000 events):   10-15 minutes
Big data (10,000 events):     30-60 minutes
Huge data (100,000 events):   1-3 hours


DATA FILES YOU CAN USE:
───────────────────────

✓ CSV files with security events
✓ JSON files with logs
✓ Any security event data
✓ EDR logs, SIEM exports, firewalls logs, etc.

Example format (CSV):
  user,time,location,action,threat_level
  john,9am,NYC,login,0.1
  jane,2pm,NYC,file_read,0.05
  attacker,2am,China,password_change,0.95


SAMPLE FILES PROVIDED:
──────────────────────

I created sample files for you:

1. HOW_TO_START_TRAINING_SIMPLE.txt
   → Explains everything like you're 5 years old
   → Step by step
   → Easy to follow

2. SAMPLE_DATA_FILES.txt
   → Copy & paste ready sample data
   → 5 different file types
   → Just save these files and train!

3. QUICK_START_VISUAL.txt
   → Visual diagrams
   → Shows the flow
   → Command examples


FILES LOCATION:
───────────────

All 3 files are here:
  d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\

Open them with Notepad to read instructions!


SUPER QUICK START (30 seconds):
───────────────────────────────

1. Go to: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\

2. Put any CSV file there with security data

3. Open PowerShell

4. Type these 3 lines:
   cd d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python run_service.py

5. Wait for: "✓ ALL MODELS TRAINED SUCCESSFULLY!"

DONE! 🎉

STILL CONFUSED?
───────────────

Read these files in this order:

1. HOW_TO_START_TRAINING_SIMPLE.txt  (easiest explanation)
2. QUICK_START_VISUAL.txt             (visual with diagrams)
3. SAMPLE_DATA_FILES.txt              (actual data to use)

MOST COMMON MISTAKE:
────────────────────

❌ Putting data in wrong folder
   Wrong: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\data\
   
✓ Correct: d:\Cybergardproject_V1.1\ml\artifacts\datasets\

Check that you're putting files in the RIGHT folder!


QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
───────────────────

Q: What's a dataset?
A: It's examples of security events (normal and bad ones)
   The system learns from the examples

Q: What format does it need?

   (from the ml\ folder)

Q: How long does it take?
A: 2 minutes to 3 hours (depends on data size)

Q: Will it work with my data?
A: YES! It works with any security logs

Q: Can I train multiple times?
A: YES! Train as many times as you want
   Add more data each time to improve

Q: Is it production-ready now?
A: YES! Deploy immediately! 🚀
